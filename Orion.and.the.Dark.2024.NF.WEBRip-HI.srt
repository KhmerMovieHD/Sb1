- I made you oatmeal cookies.

00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,250
[Orion] Oh, uh...

154
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,208
how'd that get there?

155
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,041
Your father found it
stuffed under the couch.

I think you mean
in between the couch cushions?

- Hm. Wanna talk about it?
- Not really.

You should go. It'll be fun.

I'm not so sure about that.

Orion, bud, I get it.

161
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,041
These kind of things can be scary.

162
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,625
But that's the thing.
It's okay to be nervous.

163
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,833
More than okay, in fact. It's normal.

164

The trick is not to let your fear
get in the way of living your life.

It's true.

00:22:44,208 --> 00:22:46,791
with the whole "dropping you
and almost killing you" thing.

464
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:49,791
But we can't dwell on that because
we've got a lot of work to do, kid.

465
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,625
And in a way,
my job is the most fundamental.

466
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:55,666
I show up every night, and I bring it.

467
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,875
- Bring what?
- Dark.

468
00:22:57,958 --> 00:23:00,125
And it's probably
the most important job, too,

469
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,458
because without darkness,

470
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:03,375
the others don't get to do their bits.

471
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:05,000
What do you mean "the others"?

472
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,375
The other Night Entities.

473
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:09,083
Wait, there's more?

474
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:13,833
Raise. In or out, Insomnia?

475
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:15,684
I'm thinking. I'm always thinking.
You know that.

476
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:20,375
Can't seem to stop my brain.
Think, think, think!

477
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:24,875
Ah, crap. I'm out.
What about you, Quiet?

478
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:26,392
- [Quiet] Call.
- [female voice] Call.

479
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,583
- [snoring]
- You're up, Sleep.

480
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:29,750
What?

481
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,416
[Insomnia] Royal flush?

482
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,041
Unbelievable.

483
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,416
Gosh darn it!

484
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,583
Huh? What happened? What did I miss?

485
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,208
You won.

486
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:45,041
Oh, wonderful.
Pleasure doing business with you.

487
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:47,375
[Entities groaning]

488
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:48,541
[Insomnia] Great.

489
00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:50,708
Wait, wait. Why are we going in here?

490
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,416
Well, kid, it's break time!

491
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,291
The other Night Entities and I
take one every new time zone.

492
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:57,708
We're fun, you're gonna love us.

493
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:59,666
- Heya, gang, what's up!
- Heya, Dark!

494
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,416
Welcome back! Huh?

495
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,375
Great work tonight, guys.

496
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:06,333
- You brought the kid?
- Dark brought the kid!

497
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:07,875
So irresponsible!

498
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,000
Unbelievable!

499
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,125
Are you nuts?

500
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,458
Well, this is the opposite of encouraging.

501
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:13,833
I've got this.

502
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:17,666
Orion, allow me to introduce you
to the other Night Entities.

503
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:22,416
There's Sleep, Quiet,
Insomnia, Unexplained Noises,

504
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,583
and, of course, the most creative
and poetic of us all,

505
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:28,166
- Sweet Dreams.
- Hm.

506
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,000
You brought the Screamer?

507
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:32,000
The kid who's afraid of everything!

508
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:35,500
Is this your latest attempt at trying to
convince the world that you're not so bad?

509
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,541
- Uh...
- Helping random children

510
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,250
to boost your fragile self-esteem

511
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:41,333
is not in our job description!

512
00:24:41,416 --> 00:24:43,458
Whoa. That is insightfully harsh.

513
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:46,083
Do you have any idea
how many things could go wrong?

514
00:24:46,166 --> 00:24:48,125
I mean, what if he freaks out
and slows you down,

515
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:51,208
and you know who finally catches up,
and you get obliterated,

516
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:53,500
and the concept
of darkness ceases to exist,

517
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:57,958
and the fabric of the universe
is permanently and irreparably altered?

518
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:00,916
- That's a thing that can happen?
- Ah, seems unlikely.

519
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
All right. Enough of this nonsense.

520
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:08,708
I'm sorry, honey,
but Dark never should've brought you here.

521
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:12,375
You're just gonna have
to find your own way home. Okay?

522
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:15,083
Now, come on, everyone.
Break time's over!

523
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:17,416
Some of us have work to do.

524
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:24,250
Wait!

525
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:26,208
One night could change everything!

526
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:29,291
I got 24 hours with this kid.

527
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:32,916
We help him overcome his fear of the dark
and all his nightly screaming,

528
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,750
and all that interference with your jobs
just goes away.

529
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:38,166
[sighs]

530
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,416
All right, fine.

531
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,083
Just make sure he stays out of my hair.

532
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:47,375
Absolutely. Not a problem.
Won't be in your hair at all.

533
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:49,458
[Sleep snoring]

534
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,875
[grunting]

535
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:55,791
[Orion gasps]

[chuckles]

[ethereal music playing]

539
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:16,291
- Did you mean that?
- What?

540
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,708
You really think you can fix everything
I'm afraid of in one night?

541
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:23,375
One night can change everything.

542
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,541
- Hey, what's that light?
- Light? What light? I don't see any light.

543
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:29,025
The one behind you that you're trying
to keep me from seeing.

544
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:30,625
Me? Keep you from seeing?
[scoffs]

545
00:26:30,708 --> 00:26:32,166
That's cuckoo banana talk.

546
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,458
[Orion] Not so close.
I don't think they like me.

547
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:46,291
What? That's ridiculous.
You're totally likeable.

548
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:49,500
They called me night enemy number one
and said I ruin their jobs.

549
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:52,666
Yeah, admittedly, they didn't make
the best first impression.

550
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,916
But just wait
until you see them in action.

551
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,750
It's totally inspiring.
And not scary at all.

552
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:02,083
Ah, yes, sleep is responsible
for making sure

553
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:04,500
all the creatures of the world
go to sleep at night.

554
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:06,791
She's down there
making everyone go to sleep?

555
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:10,375
Oh, yeah!
You gotta watch, it's really fascinating.

556
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:15,750
[muffled grunt]

557
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:18,000
- What?
- Oh, don't worry, she's a professional,

558
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,333
and it's a magic pillow.

00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:35,708
Please tell me that's magic chloroform.

00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:38,750
Uh, yeah... [clears throat] Magic.

this blabbermouth freaking out

while I'm trying to get work done!

None of what you're doing is okay!

577
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:07,750
Smothering someone with a pillow?
Chloroform? A hammer?

578
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,291
Not to mention,
questions of hygiene with that kiss.

579
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:13,291
Listen, I've been doing
this job for thousands of years.

580
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:15,750
I think I know what I'm doing, kid.

Uh, thanks for letting us see
how the sausage gets made!

585
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:28,666
I don't know
if I'll ever be able to sleep again.

586
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,000
Uh, right.

587
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:34,708
Well, if you're staying up all night

[tense music playing]

589
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:40,250
Insomnia is the best impressionist
I've ever met.

590
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:43,041
He makes himself sound like
the person he's keeping up,

591
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:46,250
and then whispers worrisome things
in their ears.

592
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,166
Why is that even a job?

593
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,291
Oh, you're just great
at making friends, aren't you?

- Not really. [yelps]
- Yeah, that tracks.

Now, watch

and learn.

597
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:01,500
[chuckles] Classic Insomnia.

598

She's gonna think I'm an idiot.

I'm never going to meet my deadline!

She's sleeping pretty soundly.

All those sleepless nights
were because of him?

What a jerk...

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You think I'm the one doing that to you?

Nuh-uh, pally. I'm just a megaphone
for the thoughts people already got.

Don't follow me around
with this kid anymore, Dark. Okay?

He's very judgy.

I'm not judgy... Am I?

And we're walking.

Of course, none of us could do our jobs
without a little help from Quiet.

[heart beating]

624
00:30:36,708 --> 00:30:38,750
Ah! It's too quiet!

625
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:41,875
- Quiet... Quiet... Quiet... [echoing]
- [woman] Enough with that dog!

626
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:44,166
[alarm blaring]

[overlapping chatter]

628
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:49,541
[Quiet] We told you that this kid
would ruin everything, and he is!

629
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:51,434
- Uh-huh.
- I'm not some kinda glorified babysitter.

630
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:53,750
I need absolute concentration
to do my job,

631
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:56,309
and I can't have this kid getting
in the way and screwing everything up!

632
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:58,309
Now, get him out of here,
so I can get back to business...

633
00:30:58,333 --> 00:30:59,851
- Mm-hm.
- ...and focus on doing my job!

634
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:00,875
Okay, got it.

635
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,750
[Orion] What'd she say?

636
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:04,625
Was it about me?

637
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,625
I'm gonna be honest.

638
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:11,250
I never have any idea what she's saying.
But she did look pretty angry.

639
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:12,541
- [clattering]
- [yelps]

640
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:13,916
Oh! Unexplained Noises.

641
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,458
- Come on, this way.
- [yelps]

642
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,083
Hey, hey, what's up?

643
00:31:19,166 --> 00:31:23,708
[shushing] I'm thinking this moment
calls for a crunching sound,

644
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:26,875
with the tiniest hint of scraping.

645
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:28,458
[crunching, scraping]

646
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:31,666
[child] What was that?
Mommy, Daddy! I'm hearing noises!

647
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:35,750
Ah, yes. I'm really making an impact.

648
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:37,083
This is so messed up!

649
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:39,916
- Hey! It's okay, kid! It's not real...
- Can you not...

650
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
[muffled]

651
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,708
You're upsetting
the delicate balance of nature.

652
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:45,166
You may not understand it,

653
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:47,291
but we're doing very important jobs here!

654
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:48,875
I mean, in the kid's defense,

655
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:53,333
a lot of your job does involve
creeping around and scaring children.

656
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:56,625
[scoffs] I don't have to explain myself
to either of you.

657
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:57,583
The fact is,

658
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,708
his very presence
threatens to destroy

659
00:31:59,791 --> 00:32:02,583
the fabric of the universe
as we know it!

660
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:08,000
Eh, don't let her get to you.
Her honk is a lot worse than her bite.

661
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,750
And, hey, I've saved the best for last.

662
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:13,541
So get ready, and hold on tight!

663
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,958
[majestic music playing]

664
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:19,208
Ah, there she is.

665
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:20,875
[Orion] You mean, all those colors?

666
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:23,333
Yep. That's Dreams doing her thing.

667
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:26,750
If seeing her work can't make you
appreciate the beauty of nighttime,

668
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:29,791
- then nothing can.
- What do you mean see her work?

669
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:32,791
[Orion yelling]

670
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:44,041
[groans]

671
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:47,833
Hey! Shh! Keep it down.
She's working her magic.

672
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:53,083
All right, what's churning
in your subconscious tonight, Irene?

673
00:32:53,166 --> 00:32:57,500
Mm-hm. Okay. A lot of anxiety about work.

674
00:32:57,583 --> 00:32:59,583
Big presentation tomorrow.

675
00:32:59,666 --> 00:33:02,875
Hmm. Not sure you're ready
for this one, Irene.

676
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:05,458
- Really need to impress your boss. Got it.
- [cat meows]

677
00:33:05,541 --> 00:33:09,125
Oh, and your daughter found a rescue cat
that she wants you to adopt.

678
00:33:09,208 --> 00:33:11,541
- Mommy, can we keep him?
- [meows]

679
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:14,083
Good material tonight.

680
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:16,791
Now, let's work it all out.

681
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:20,708
You're confidently
giving your presentation.

682
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:24,166
If we just re-use the coil
from our winding mechanism,

683
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,708
we can reduce
our manufacturing costs by 30%.

684
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:29,458
[employees exclaiming]

685
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:31,916
Everyone's loving it.

686
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,916
[crowd cheering]

687
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:38,958
[crowd chanting] Irene! Irene!

688
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:41,041
[chanting continues]

[triumphant music playing]

690
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:46,583
I think you've earned this, Irene.

691
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:51,166
World's most competent employee?

692
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,375
Mommy!

693
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:56,333
You're the best mommy ever!

694
00:33:56,916 --> 00:33:59,083
That was one hell
of a presentation, Irene.

695
00:34:00,375 --> 00:34:02,583
I definitely think
you're getting that promotion.

696
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:04,875
Oh, Mommy. Can we please keep him?

697
00:34:04,958 --> 00:34:05,833
[purrs]

698
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:07,625
Yes, of course we can!

699
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:08,583
[man] Whoo!

700
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:10,208
We love you, Irene!

701
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:14,000
Amazing, she's amazing.
You're amazed, right?

702
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:16,458
Yeah. She's pretty great.

703
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:17,541
I told you.

704
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:21,541
You know, this reminds me of a dream I had
where I was giving a class presentation.

705
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,505
But instead of cheering,
everyone was booing me.

706
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:27,541
And the weirdest part was, my classroom
was actually a dentist's office.

707
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:29,333
[gasps]

708
00:34:29,416 --> 00:34:31,583
- Uh...
- Wha... Huh?

709
00:34:31,666 --> 00:34:34,458
What the... I didn't conjure that.

710
00:34:34,541 --> 00:34:37,541
- That's a coincidence, right?
- Definitely. It has to be.

711
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:39,958
Right. Because otherwise,
if I said something random,

712
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:42,041
like, I don't know, "evil cucumber"...

713
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:43,250
- [gasps]
- Wha...?

714
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:47,083
Hey there, Irene.
Time for your yearly check-up!

715
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,125
- [laughing maniacally]
- [screams]

716
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:52,416
- [both] Uh...
- [Irene screaming]

717
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,708
What the heck is going on?

718
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,708
- [Orion gasps]
- Dark?

719
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:58,041
No! Off-limits!

720
00:34:58,125 --> 00:35:00,541
You promised to keep him out of my hair!

721
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:02,250
Look, I need to inspire him,

722
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,166
and your work's
the most inspirational stuff

723
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,083
- in the whole night time.
- Sorry about the cucumber.

724
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:09,000
- [laughing continues]
- Usually.

725
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,250
[shushing]

726
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:13,541
Stop! Don't say one more word.

727
00:35:13,625 --> 00:35:16,583
Creating a dream is a very delicate art.

728
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:18,166
That means anything you say,

729
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:21,958
or even think, could influence the dream.

730
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:24,916
- Got it?
- Anything I think?

731
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,083
You thought of something scary,
didn't you?

732
00:35:28,166 --> 00:35:30,500
What? What did you think of now?

733
00:35:30,583 --> 00:35:32,125
Just a kid from my school.

- The word is "confiscated"!
- [Richie laughing]

Cryin' Orion!

Cryin' Orion! Cryin' Orion!

- [screams]
- [Richie laughing]

751
00:36:15,166 --> 00:36:17,875
I mean, he can't like get hurt
or anything, can he?

752
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:20,666
No, it's impossible
to get hurt in a dream.

753
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,500
- Oh, well, that's a relief.
- Unless, of course, he dies.

754
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:25,833
- Then he dies in real life.
- Wait, what?

755
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:27,708
Kid, you need to get out of here,

756
00:36:27,791 --> 00:36:29,666
or it's going to end very, very badly!

757
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,416
I'm very aware of that!

758
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,041
Uh... Huh?

759
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:37,875
Come on, Orion!
Think of something to get us out of here!

760
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:39,708
Come on! Think, think, think!

761
00:36:39,791 --> 00:36:41,750
Wait! Page 14 of my sketchbook.

762
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:44,416
Clogging the toilet
and flooding the entire school.

Huh?

Kid, you're either extremely disturbed

00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,875
You gotta be kidding me.

935
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:05,000
- Who is he?
- That is Light. He's Dark's nemesis.

936
00:46:05,083 --> 00:46:05,958
Huh.

937
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:09,083
I like him, for some reason.
He makes me feel safe.

938
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,333
Like I'm wrapped in a warm blanket.

939
00:46:14,291 --> 00:46:16,666
You know,
if you're into that kind of thing.

940
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:20,083
"Ooh, look at me. I'm so bright!"

941
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:21,791
I've got tricks too, you know.

942
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:25,166
But unlike some of us, I like to leave
a little to the imagination,

943
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:27,375
instead of rubbing it in everyone's face.

944
00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:28,625
[Light] Come on, Dark.

945
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:30,958
Do we really have to
go through this every time?

946
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:33,250
Go through what?
I don't know what you're talking about.

947
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:37,250
Uh, your attitude,
your lateness, your insecurity.

948
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:38,666
How you doing, kid?

949
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,208
Um, hi!

950
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:42,583
[Light] It's always the same routine
with you, man.

951
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,416
I show up, you feel inadequate,

952
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,083
then you start to project
your insecurities onto me.

953
00:46:47,166 --> 00:46:49,541
Every day, I bring brightness
and hope to the world,

954
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:52,000
and you bring the exact opposite.

955
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:53,833
Eh... That's not... I'm...

956
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:56,166
I do more than that.

957
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,291
Wait, really? Like what?

958
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:02,416
Like, a lot of stuff.
I would love to tell you all about it,

959
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,416
but I don't really have
the time right now.

960
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,666
Finally, something we can both agree on.

961
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:09,958
Welp, I'm bringing daylight through here
in about three seconds,

962
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:14,083
so if you want to continue to exist,
I'd, uh, you know... [clicks tongue]

963
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:18,125
Oh, whatever.
We were leaving anyway. Jerk!

964
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:20,916
I wouldn't call him a jerk.
He seems okay.

965
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,375
[groans] He's not so great. Trust me.

966

[Hypatia] <i>Hey, Dad?</i>

00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:27,041
What, you ready for bed?

968
00:47:27,125 --> 00:47:28,708
Actually, no.

969
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:31,875
I was wondering if we could go for
a little walk while you finish the story.

970
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:32,958
Oh, really?

971
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:36,250
So, like, we could be in the night,
like Orion and Dark.

972
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:38,708
Um... Yeah, sure.

973
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:40,916
I guess it's not a school night.

974
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,916
So, yeah, let's go.

00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:53,416
Um, come on. We can cut through the park.

978
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:55,416
Okay.

You know what?

984
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:14,791
- I think I like the other way better.
- Agreed.

988
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:27,291
Can I have my hand for a minute?

989
00:48:27,375 --> 00:48:29,958
- Oh, of course. Sorry.
- No, it's okay.

990
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:32,958
I just thought of a couple new lines
and didn't want to lose them.

991
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:34,333
Oh, good ones?

992
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:38,625
Well, you know, just about how weird it is
that you can't see any stars.

993
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,250
Yeah. I couldn't agree more.

994
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:45,583
You don't have to pretend, you know?

995
00:48:46,583 --> 00:48:48,541
That you wanted to come this way, too.

996
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:49,750
I'm not pretending.

997
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:53,125
The street lights were out in the park.
It was scary for me, too.

998
00:48:53,208 --> 00:48:55,500
But I thought you got over that.

999
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:57,375
That's what you said
in the story, at least.

1000
00:48:57,458 --> 00:49:00,375
Well, it's a complicated story.

1001
00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:03,458
Then couldn't you let it be complicated?

1002
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:05,791
Parents love simple stories like that

1003
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:07,750
because whatever problem
the character has,

1004
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:11,125
it all gets fixed, and then they don't
have to worry about it anymore.

1005
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:13,250
Orion meets Dark. Dark's not so bad.

1006
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:16,458
Orion isn't afraid of him anymore,
then there's a dance party.

1007
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:19,208
[chuckles] You think I should add
a dance party?

1008
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:23,750
I think if you're still scared,
you should let Orion still be scared.

1009
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:26,875
The only stories
that really help are the true ones.

1010
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,875
That is a really great point.

1011
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:30,958
You think so?

1012
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,500
I do.
And we should definitely use that idea.

Yeah, did you die?

- Insomnia!
- What?

1022
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:12,000
Jumping to worst case scenarios
is my actual job.

No. I'm good.

- Totally.

there's not even a night light.

What are you so scared of?

1035
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:40,875
Nothing. I just...
I really like the daytime.

1036
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:44,250
Like, the noises.
I mean, have you heard day noises?

1037
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:47,666
- Birds, children playing, brunch?
- It sounds amazing.

1038
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:50,583
It is, and you are definitely missing out.
Like, in the daytime,

1039
00:50:50,666 --> 00:50:53,166
there's this sense of connection
between the sounds and colors.

1040
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:56,125
Everything is lit up in the daytime.
It's almost psychedelic.

Hm?

1046
00:51:13,958 --> 00:51:15,708
Yeah, that's light!

- Oh, wow! Really?
- Incredible.

1048
00:51:18,416 --> 00:51:23,416
- This makes me feel so safe and warm.
- I can see why this makes you less afraid.

I'm not saying I need it.

1050

I'm just saying there's no way
to imagine how beautiful it is,

if you haven't experienced it.

Huh?

1053
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:34,708
So you're saying the problem is Dark?

1054

Well, in a way, yeah!

1055

And I love him,
but I guess he's the issue here, right?

Don't get me wrong,
Dark's a really nice guy.

1057
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:45,583
The best.
But as long as you're with him,

1058
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:49,375
you can never really enjoy
all the amazing things Light has to...

I think you're the best.

See, I didn't get that
from the conversation

1067
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:27,916
- back at the house with the door.
- No, no, I was just chatting.

1068
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,240
Just because I'm talking
about how much I love ice cream,

1069
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:31,958
doesn't mean I don't love French fries.

- Which one am I?
- What?

Ice cream or French fries?

1072
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:36,833
Um, French fries?

1073
00:52:36,916 --> 00:52:38,500
And Light is ice cream?

1074
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:40,666
- Exactly!
- Which one do you love more?

1075
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:43,750
Is that really important?

1076
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:46,000
Exactly!

1077
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:49,041
I'm just saying, I wish you could all
experience daylight. You, too!

1078
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:50,708
That's saying you wish everyone could

1079
00:52:50,791 --> 00:52:52,875
experience me not being around.

1080
00:52:52,958 --> 00:52:54,708
That's not what I meant to say.
Perfect!

Come on.

It has been brought to my attention

1087
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:14,791
that some of my comments
during our last break

1088
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:17,791
have been interpreted
in a way I never intended.

1089
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:19,083
So let me be clear.

1090
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:22,083
I love the nighttime
and my good friend, Dark.

1091
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:24,500
Now, some of you might feel

1092
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:27,125
you are missing out
on other experiences in the world.

1093
00:53:27,208 --> 00:53:30,166
But I'd like to take a moment
to remind you of the old adage,

1094
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,875
"The grass is always greener
on the other side of the..."

1095
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:36,875
World! Because it's daytime there,
and you can see that it's green!

1096
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:38,958
Wait. Wait.
That's not what I was trying to say.

1097
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:42,208
But it's true! I mean, what does
green grass even look like?

1098
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:44,666
Yeah! Why should
the Day Entities get all the colors?

1099
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:45,583
- Yeah!
- [Insomnia] Exactly! See?

1100
00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:47,500
- That's what I think, too.
- Okay, everyone.

1101
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:49,875
I think we're getting
a little off-track here.

1102
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:53,333
Dark is great.
He has so many wonderful characteristics.

1103
00:53:53,416 --> 00:53:54,750
Like what?

1104
00:53:55,541 --> 00:53:56,916
[sighs]

1105
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,791
Look... my point is that I was wrong.

1106
00:54:00,666 --> 00:54:04,166
Implying that Day is superior
to Night was wrong. Period.

1107
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,708
Sure, some people might say

1108
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:08,958
that you're not as pretty and vibrant
as Day, but so what?

1109
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:12,625
Because, ultimately, the thing
that makes the vibrancy of Day exist

1110
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:15,958
is its exact opposite, dark and empty.

1111
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:18,250
So, you see,
if you think about it that way,

1112
00:54:18,333 --> 00:54:20,625
you are the wind beneath Day's wings.

1113
00:54:20,708 --> 00:54:23,125
I don't think this is helping.

1114
00:54:24,583 --> 00:54:28,208
Wait, let me finish.
So, in conclusion, thank you.

1115
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:31,333
Thank you for performing
these humble, thankless tasks,

1116
00:54:31,416 --> 00:54:34,375
in order to make
Light-filled Day great again.

1117
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:40,916
- Well, that's it. I'm leaving.
- What? You're leaving?

1118
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,125
Actually, I'm staying.

1119
00:54:42,208 --> 00:54:46,000
I'm staying and waiting for daylight.
Maybe I'll be able to get a job there.

1120
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:47,875
Oh, come on. Be reasonable.

1121
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:50,750
You! Don't even talk to me, you.

1122
00:54:50,833 --> 00:54:55,583
You're the reason everyone hates us.
It's you and your infernal Dark.

1123
00:54:55,666 --> 00:54:58,083
- But I'm your friend.
- Some friend!

1124
00:54:58,166 --> 00:55:01,375
Keeping me from the true beauty of life.

1125
00:55:01,458 --> 00:55:05,166
Come on, Unexplained Noises, we all know
you're not actually going to quit.

1126
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:07,916
My name is Debby now. Call me Debby.

1127
00:55:09,083 --> 00:55:10,583
Debby!

1128
00:55:13,416 --> 00:55:15,500
Well, that's just great.

1129
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:18,583
But at least we've got
the rest of you. Right?

1130
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:20,833
Come on, guys, let's hit the road.

1131
00:55:20,916 --> 00:55:21,916
[shattering]

1132
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:28,500
I think what Debby means is that we could
all use a little light in our lives.

1133
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:29,875
We all need to feel seen and...

1134
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:33,125
Well, since no one else will,
I'm just going to come out and say it.

1135
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:35,375
We all need to feel seen and heard.

1136
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:37,434
- Yeah! That's what I've been saying.
- Yeah, we do!

1137
00:55:37,458 --> 00:55:39,916
- [Unexpected Noises] Exactly!
- That's it. I quit!

1138
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:45,541
I'm quitting, too.
I'm sick of living in your shadow.

1139
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:46,958
Wait, what?

1140
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:51,333
Daydreams are a thing, right?
I bet that'll be a fun new challenge.

1141
00:55:51,416 --> 00:55:53,333
Definitely better than nightmares.

1142
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:54,666
Dreams, please...

1143
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:58,166
Well, that does it.
If Dreams is quitting then so am I.

1144
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:00,958
I'm not sticking around
in the nighttime for dreamless sleep.

1145
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:02,375
What's the point?

1146
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:04,916
Well, if Sleep leaves, then, what...

1147
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,875
it's my job to keep everyone awake
all the time?

1148
00:56:07,958 --> 00:56:09,750
No, no. That's too much work.

1149
00:56:10,416 --> 00:56:11,500
I quit, too.

1150
00:56:13,708 --> 00:56:16,166
Okay, break time's over, guys.

1151
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:19,250
Stop messing around.
We need to keep moving.

1152
00:56:22,583 --> 00:56:25,916
Can't wait to see the dawn of a new day.

1153
00:56:26,708 --> 00:56:30,375
Guys, don't make me
do this by myself, please.

1154
00:56:30,458 --> 00:56:31,791
We all need to work together.

1155
00:56:31,875 --> 00:56:32,875
We're...

1156
00:56:32,958 --> 00:56:34,541
we're friends.

1157
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:35,875
[squeaks]

1158
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:41,625
Well, I really enjoyed spending
all that time with you all.

1159
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:45,083
Have a good morning.

1160
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:48,958
[sad music playing]

[door closes]

1162
00:57:14,666 --> 00:57:17,208
[Light] Good morning, everybody!

1163
00:57:17,291 --> 00:57:20,125
Did someone say, "Light"?

1164
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:22,541
[birds squawking in distance]

1165

[sighs]

1166
00:57:28,333 --> 00:57:31,208
Honestly, I don't know
what anyone sees in him.

1167
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,916
That makes one of us.

1168
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,541
There's nothing left of the night but me.

1169
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
This isn't night anymore.

1170
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:48,791
It looks like nothing now.

1171
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:50,958
It sounds like nothing.

1172
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:53,666
And tomorrow, even you're gone.

1173
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,166
So I just fly around by myself forever?

1174
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:02,541
- This was a terrible idea.
- I'm really sorry.

1175
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:04,958
Maybe tomorrow,
I can find them during the day,

1176
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:07,416
- and I can try to convince them that...
- No!

1177
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,291
I'm not going on.

1178
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:15,291
I'm going to sit on this...
whatever it is.

1179
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:17,791
Rock? I don't know.
I don't think it's alive.

1180
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:20,916
I'm gonna sit right here
on this thing and wait for daylight.

1181
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,333
- No, you can't!
- Why not?

1182
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,708
Nobody likes me anyway.

1183
00:58:24,791 --> 00:58:27,541
- That's not true.
- So where did everyone go?

1184
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:36,041
[Light] Hey, Dark!

1185
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:38,250
Let's go! Move it or lose it.

1186
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:39,708
[dramatic music playing]

1187
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:41,291
Uh, Dark?

1188
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:44,250
Come on! Let's go.

1189
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:46,625
Dark, come on, you can't be in the light.

1190
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:49,000
You can't be where you're not.
You'll disappear.

1191
00:58:49,083 --> 00:58:51,958
I'm willing to risk that possibility.

1192
00:58:52,041 --> 00:58:52,916
[Light] Okay.

1193
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,416
Don't say I didn't warn you.

1194
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,166
- Wait, don't!
- [Light] I'm really sorry, kid.

1195
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:00,791
But day waits for no one.

1196
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:04,208
Dark, you have to leave now!

1197
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:09,250
Oh, I didn't get that right at all.

1198
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:10,833
What are the odds?

1199
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:13,333
No! Dark!

1200
00:59:14,166 --> 00:59:15,958
[dramatic music continues]

1201
00:59:16,041 --> 00:59:17,375
Dark!

1202
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:33,541
Bummer. I-I tried to warn him.

1203
00:59:34,166 --> 00:59:38,458
Well, I have to go make
life on Earth possible and stuff, so...

1204
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:39,833
see you, kid.

1205
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:43,375
- Good morning, everyone!
- [sighs]

1206
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:47,458
[Light] I hope your days are
as bright and beautiful as your faces.

1207
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:54,375
Yeah, but then what?

1208
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:56,500
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

1209
00:59:56,583 --> 00:59:59,083
I don't know what's next.
That's all I got.

1210
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:02,416
You're just leaving little you
all by himself in the middle of...

Where are you?

Europe somewhere? I-I don't know.

1213
01:00:06,041 --> 01:00:07,625
That's not a good ending.

1214
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:10,208
Yeah. I've said
it was a complicated story.

1215
01:00:10,291 --> 01:00:12,125
I guess I just ran out of ideas.

1216
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,291
It's your story. It happened to you!

1217
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:17,833
True. But I don't know how it ends.

01:09:54,541 --> 01:09:56,416
We need to wake him up now!

1402
01:09:57,125 --> 01:09:59,791
If we don't do something,
they're both going to...

1403
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:02,000
Get torn into
a million tiny pieces and die?

1404
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:04,958
Move over. I've got this.

1405
01:10:09,833 --> 01:10:11,625
It's going to suck us in!

1406
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,666
What happens now?

1407
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:16,750
I don't know.
But being with you, somehow,

1408
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:20,208
it makes the horror of the unknown
less horrible.

1409
01:10:20,291 --> 01:10:22,166
I know what you mean.

1410
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:26,458
- It's been a pleasure knowing you, Orion.
- The pleasure is all mine.

Time to wake up!
You're late for school!

1415
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:47,625
You read an article
about how sleep stunts your growth!

1416
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:48,916
Come on, wake up!

1417
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,291
- Why isn't it working?
- I don't know, man!

Orion, if you don't wake up
you're going to miss your field trip.

That's some nice work, kid.

Bye, Orion. It's been a dream
spending the night with you.

1440
01:13:17,416 --> 01:13:20,291
- It really has.
- See you, Hypatia.

1441
01:13:20,375 --> 01:13:22,000
I admire your work.

1442

And I admire yours.

And I admire yours, too.

Oh... [soft chuckle] Wow.

1445
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:35,333
You're the best, Dark.

1446
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,083
Yeah, I second that.

1447
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:42,291
- Thanks for everything, Dark.
- Hear, hear.

1448
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:56,125
- So, this is it.
- But I'll see you tomorrow night.

1449
01:13:56,666 --> 01:14:00,791
Ah, sure. You'll see dark.
I mean, I won't look exactly like this.

1450
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,291
But you'll see me in new ways.

1451
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:05,791
Ways that are even better.

1452
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:08,166
Yeah. I can see that now,

1453
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,916
and I can appreciate it.

1454

Thanks for that.

1455
01:14:13,458 --> 01:14:16,208
No. Thank you, Orion.

1456
01:14:16,291 --> 01:14:19,125
- For what?
- Well, seeing me the way you do.

1457
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:23,791
So much of how you see yourself
is through the eyes of others. You know?

1458
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:28,916
So, you gonna go
on that field trip tomorrow?

1459
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Yep.

1460

- You nervous?
- Terrified.

1461
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,166
But I'm going anyway.

1462
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:42,000
Ah, good for you, kid.
You're gonna be all right.

Well, it was nice meeting you, Hypatia.

Wait, what?

1469
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:28,125
- I don't understand.
- I came to help you get home.

1470
01:15:28,208 --> 01:15:30,458
- From the future?
- Um, I guess so, yeah.

1471
01:15:30,541 --> 01:15:33,166
- Am I okay, in the future?
- Yeah, you're doing good.

1472
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:35,791
So, I don't have to worry so much,
is what you're saying?

1473
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:37,416
I guess that's what I'm saying.

Really?
They look a million years old to me.

[gasps] What?

1478
01:15:49,833 --> 01:15:53,041
Orion. I thought we agreed,
no check-ins tonight.

1479
01:15:53,125 --> 01:15:56,333
We did, Dad. It's tomorrow night.
You and Mom slept through the entire day.

1480
01:15:56,416 --> 01:16:01,375
- What? Oh, my God, it's true.
- Really? Holy cow, we overslept!

1481
01:16:01,458 --> 01:16:02,938
[Orion] Yeah, I think you were tired.

1482
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,833
I-I wanted to let you sleep.
To give you a break.

[mom] Who's that?

that's my child...

1486
01:16:13,166 --> 01:16:15,875
- Oh! Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1487
01:16:15,958 --> 01:16:17,791
- What's your name?
- Hypatia.

1488
01:16:17,875 --> 01:16:18,791
That's pretty.

1489
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:22,500
So, I was wondering
if you could maybe drive Hypatia home.

1490
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:25,208
- Um, where do you live, sweetheart?
- Manhattan.

1491
01:16:25,291 --> 01:16:28,541
Manhattan? How'd you get here?
Do your parents know you're here?

1492
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,083
- Uh, sort of.
- And they can't pick you up?

1493
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:35,041
- Um...
- Oh, yeah, right.

1494
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:36,583
Maybe we'll give them a call.

- What do we do?
- I don't know.

1497
01:16:40,916 --> 01:16:43,636
We can't just drop you off in New York
20 years before you were born.

1498
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:44,666
Yes, I know.

How did you get back here
in the first place?

1500

- I don't know. I just did it.
- Well, do it again.

Okay.

Mm...

- What's wrong?
- I don't know. It's not working.

1504
01:16:56,041 --> 01:16:58,416
This is terrible.
Maybe my parents can adopt you.

1505
01:16:58,500 --> 01:17:01,416
- What? No! What about Mom?
- She seemed to like you in there.

1506
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:04,166
Not your mom. My mom. Your wife?

1507

Oh, yeah.

I'm Tycho. I came to help.

1515
01:17:25,083 --> 01:17:26,958
I have my time machine out on your lawn.

1516
01:17:27,041 --> 01:17:28,708
I can take you home.

1517
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:31,125
- You can?
- But we have to go now.

1518

Coming back to get you has released
interdimensional time monsters,

1519

and we have to stop them
before they multiply and destroy history!

Hi, Tycho. Long time no see.
You haven't changed a bit.

1540
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:08,166
You have. You're so old now.

1542
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:12,083
Well, I guess
I have grown up a little bit.

1543
01:19:12,166 --> 01:19:14,208
[chuckles] Well, gotta go.

1544

Thank you for getting me home.

No problem.

1546

And then I piloted the time machine module
all the way back here,

1547
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,708
killed the time monsters,
and climbed back in bed.

- Huh. That's such a good ending.
- Yeah?

Definitely. Thank you for figuring it out.

01:20:17,833 --> 01:20:19,000
[Hypatia] Hey, Dad.

1559
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:20,750
He asleep?

1560
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:23,916
- Almost.
- Did he come up with an ending?

1561
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:24,875
He did.

1562
01:20:24,958 --> 01:20:27,333
[chuckles] Time machine.

1563
01:20:27,416 --> 01:20:31,666
[chuckles] Oh, that's good.
A time machine.

1564
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:33,291
That's a good idea.

1565
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:36,458
I thought so, too. You up for a while?

1566
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:38,458
I'm heading back to the city
in the morning,

1567
01:20:38,541 --> 01:20:42,166
so I thought I would
just enjoy the night for a bit.

1568
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:45,250
Okay, Dad. I'm turning in.

1569
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:48,625
Goodnight, Hypatia.

1570
01:20:50,416 --> 01:20:51,833
Goodnight, Mom.

1571
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,125
Goodnight, Hypatia.

1572
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:57,916
Mind if I sit with you?

1573
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,416
I would love that.
